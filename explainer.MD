## The problem we’re solving

The digital industry has a significant sustainability impact, which affects people worldwide: 

- responsible for between 2-5% of global emissions \[[ICT-IMPACT](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html#bib-ict-impact)\] \[[EUC](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html#bib-euc)\] \[[8BT](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html#bib-8bt)\] \[[UN](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html#bib-un)\] \[[WB](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html#bib-wb)\], more than those of the aviation industry.   
- since the Paris Agreement, average web page sizes have increased by over 70% on desktop and 140% on mobile \[[PAGE-WEIGHT](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html#bib-page-weight)\].   
- between 2015 and 2021, internet users increased by 60%, whilst internet traffic increased by 440% \[[DATA](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html#bib-data)\]. 

There is plenty of opportunity to reduce that impact, and many organisations want to do so. Reasons include cost-saving, legal compliance and corporate responsibility.

Hands-on advice on how to make digital products and services more sustainable is not currently available in a systematic, widely reviewed, openly developed, and standardised format.

## Approach

The Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) help design and implement digital products and services that are more sustainable.

The WSG are designed to put people and planet first. They are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research. They are also aligned with open standards from Global Reporting Initiative ([GRI](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/summary.html#bib-gri)) and with work on carbon intensity metrics from the Green Software Foundation ([SCI-Web](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/pull/199)).

The guidelines can be used by individuals and organisations to improve products, and to show progress in their road to becoming more sustainable (the aim is “progress over perfection”).

## Practical use cases

| Audience | They can use WSG to… |
| :---- | :---- |
| People making digital products and services (including web developers, user experience designers, infrastructure and system engineers, business strategists, product managers) | …make their products and services more sustainable. |
| Organisations responsible for digital products and services, sustainability program leaders | …track their progress in improving sustainability. |
| Authoring Tools and User Agents | …build tooling that helps improve sustainability into their products. |
| Regulators and policy makers | …have a standardised way to understand what improving sustainability looks like. |

## Alternatives Considered

n/a 

For content organisation, currently by discipline, we previously considered organising by what's tested (website, system, tool), and by [principle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fsw38rJ0IgF_Vhln6IrSG5YmO6zWk9Fu/view%20), like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines’ POUR principles. We decided against those, as we considered a filtering system to be the best way for people to find what they want.

## Accessibility, Internationalization, Privacy, and Security Considerations

Where applicable, accessibility, internationalisation, privacy, and security have been considered throughout development of the Web Sustainability Guidelines. [A list of guidelines to these areas](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/#considerations) is available.
