		<section id="abstract"> <!-- Abstract -->
			<p>Web Sustainability Guidelines (<abbr title="Web Sustainability Guidelines">WSG</abbr>) covers a wide range of recommendations for making websites and products more sustainable. Following these guidelines which utilize planetary, people, and prosperity (<abbr title="Planet, People, and Prosperity">PPP</abbr>) principles throughout the decision-making processes, you can minimize your environmental impact through a mixture of user-centered design, performant web development, renewable infrastructure, sustainable business Strategy, and (with metrics) various combinations of those mentioned. It should be noted that these guidelines will not address every possible mechanism or Strategy to become sustainable, as such, these guidelines (which are notably Web orientated and focused) should be seen as a starting point in a sustainability journey (coverage does not extend for example to manufacturing or shipping of physical products). Following these guidelines will often make Web content more accessible, usable, and performant as a by-product.</p>
			<p>To use these guidelines, it is highly recommended that you take a methodical approach. Rather than working through the entire document and broadly attempting to apply everything held within to your project or service, scroll through the table of contents to find a guideline that appeals to either your skill set or that you (based upon the impact / effort rating) feel comfortable in attempting to tackle. Sustainable change is measured in progress over perfection and by breaking down the specification into achievable goals based upon guidelines or even success criteria, you can more easily progress toward long-term targets. Guideline examples and resources may also provide implementation guidance while benefits can help justify their usage to management.</p>

		<section id="sotd"> <!-- Status of This Document -->
			<p>This document has been reviewed by Interest Group members and interested parties. This is a draft document which may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this document as other than a work in progress. The Interest Group's role in publishing is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment.</p>
			<p>By publishing these guidelines, the Interest Group does not expect that the work produced in this specification will affect the work undertaken by other <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> sustainability, accessibility, or performance groups. The Interest Group will continue to track these Working, Interest, and Community Groups as appropriate. This specification closely aligns itself with the principles laid down for Web Platform Design [[design-principles]], Privacy [[privacy-principles]], the Ethical Web [[ethical-web-principles]], and Human Rights [[HR-Spec]].</p>
			<p>To provide feedback regarding this specification, the preferred method is using GitHub. It is free to create a GitHub account to file issues. Comments received on the specification cannot result in changes to this version of the guidelines but may be addressed in errata or future versions of WSG. A list of issues filed as well as archives of previous mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-sustainableweb@w3.org">public-sustainableweb@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sustainableweb/">archive</a>) discussions are publicly available. There is currently no preliminary interoperability or implementation report, however one of the key tasks of this Interest Group is to examine the potential for better models for digital sustainability that can feed into tooling (and thus into large studies of implementations) that can be reported upon and fed back into guidance for the Web Sustainability Guidelines.</p>

			<section> <!-- Background -->
				<h3>Background on WSG</h3>
				<p>In 1999, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[WCAG22]] defined a set of baseline guidance for Web content developers and creators of authoring tools, with the primary goal of promoting Web accessibility through the adoption of inclusive strategies. Through a similar methodology, the Web Sustainability Guidelines promote planetary, people, and prosperity best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, stakeholders, website or application creators, tool authors, tool authors, educators, students, policymakers, purchasing agents, product owners, managers, and decision-makers, with the primary goal of reducing harm to the wider ecosystem (regarding people and the planet) through sustainable Strategy adoption.</p>
				<p>For those unfamiliar with sustainability issues relating to the Web, consider that many variables [[VARIABLES]] may contribute to waste or emissions being produced online.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The way data is sent or received between client and server.</li>
					<li>Hosting, environments, arrays, and infrastructure.</li>
					<li>Consumer devices, components, and variability in conditions.</li>
					<li>Software like Web browsers (rendering engines and code), operating systems, assistive tools, and applications.</li>
					<li>Human-centered design features include legislation, accessibility, and the vast field of usability.</li>
					<li>Development workflows, business operations, and tooling.</li>
					<li>The visitor's equipment, environment, and behavior.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) is developed in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world. It does so intending to provide a shared Strategy for Web sustainability that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WSG is designed to apply broadly to different existing Web technologies and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation.</p>
				<p>Web sustainability depends not only on sustainable websites and products but also on sustainable Web browsers and other user agents, examples include the performance of rendering and the accurate measuring of website energy use through developer tooling. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web sustainability, by ensuring performant code, reducing waste, and the results are served in the most sustainable way possible.</p>
				<p>Significant challenges were encountered in finding existing research data to both identify and establish guidance for all the variables that affect Web sustainability, which came as no surprise with the subject being such an emerging and rapidly evolving field. Work will continue in this area in future versions of WSG.</p>
				<div class="note">
					<p>The WSG were originally developed under the guidance of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/">Sustainable Web Design Community Group</a>. W3C Community Groups act as incubator hubs where ideas for new technologies and standards can be discussed without formal constraints.</p>
					<p>Over two years with the help of over 100 subject matter experts from around the globe, the group created the first draft, and subsequently through GitHub and regular meetings continued over another year to progress the WSG and its supplements to a level of maturity in which the group and its work were ready to become a part of the W3C family (where this specification continues being developed to this day).</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Layers -->
				<h3>WSG layers of guidance</h3>
				<p>The individuals and organizations that use WSG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policymakers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. To meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including general guidelines, testable success criteria, impact and effort ratings, advisory potential benefits, documented examples, Global Reporting Initiative (<abbr title="Global Reporting Initiative">GRI</abbr>) ratings, evidence-based links, and category tags.</p>
				<p>All of these layers of guidance (guidelines, success criteria, impact, effort, benefits, reporting, examples, resources, and tags) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more sustainable. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they can (relevance, time, or budget permitting), including the additional content, to best make their product or service the most sustainable it can become. It should be considered that while great care has been taken to make these guidelines as well-rounded and feature-complete as possible, there will likely be additional tasks authors can perform to improve sustainability which this specification failed to address due to (for example) new techniques becoming available.</p>
				<section> <!-- Principles -->
					<h4>Principles</h4>
					<p>At the top are <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">six principles</a> that provide the foundation for <a>Web Sustainability</a>: clean, efficient, open, honest, regenerative, and resilient.</p>
					<p>These guiding principles were chosen to act as the foundation of the WSG on the basis that they opened the conversation as to what Web sustainability could and should mean for website or application creators and product owners attempting to make a change to benefit people and the planet.</p>
					<p>While the primary focus of our guidelines is sustainability in the environmental impact sense, to avoid narrowing our definition, as with many frameworks this specification takes an <a>PPP approach</a> to sustainability. The benefit of this methodology is that while we do recognize the importance of energy / carbon accounting and reduction, we avoid carbon tunnel vision and seek to approach digital sustainability reductions through additional measures such as through the reduction of water waste and raw material conservation such as paper. We also are mindful of the social aspects of sustainability and the importance of people as well as the planet, thereby including important criteria, notes, and cross-links where appropriate to W3C work in accessibility, privacy, and other groups and including mentions of Corporate Digital Responsibility (<abbr title="Corporate Digital Responsibility">CDR</abbr>), ethical behavior, and other important disciplines.</p>
					<p>Of course, principles on their own do not make for good testable guidelines, which is why our guidelines are as heavily evidence-weighted as possible, aligning with existing sustainability reporting frameworks and standards (such as GRI). We also have made every effort possible to map our work to comply with existing and upcoming worldwide regulatory frameworks to assist with compliance.</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- Guidelines -->
					<h4>Guidelines</h4>
					<p>Under the principles are guidelines. These guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward to make content more sustainable. The guidelines provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria, which are testable against, to implement better digital solutions. This specification groups guidelines within four categories (User Experience Design, Web Development, Infrastructure, Product and Business) that overarches various specialisms. It should, however, be noted that while many of these guidelines are curated into categories for simplicity, often they are not limited to a single group and can be utilized within other specialisms for a sustainability benefit. They also come equipped with tags that can be utilized by third-party user-agent tools to filter the criteria on journeys, categories, preferences, or additional variables to benefit the author during the implementation process.</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- Success -->
					<h4>Success Criteria</h4>
					<p>For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided. WSG success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria is provided in separate documents or within third-party sources as cited evidence. Details regarding machine testability and whether human testing or intervention is required in order to meet a success criteria are indicated against each success criteria. Resources (third-party evidence-based links) are denoted to allow authors to better understand and meet the Success Criteria for compliance purposes. These Resources are also provided within a separate document and all information within is subject to change.</p>
					<p class="note">This specification offers interactivity. You can filter and see only the Success Criteria that apply to your interests / choices by viewing the <a href="#full-document">Full Document</a> mode of the WSG and clicking the interactive "Filter the available WSG Success Criteria upon certain settings" link at the top of the content. Your choices will reveal themselves upon selecting from the categories and checkboxes.</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- Additional -->
					<h4>Additional information</h4>
					<p>These guidelines come with both an impact and effort rating system. Unlike other W3C specifications, WSG uses a simple system of Low, Medium, or High ratings against each individual guideline to reduce the burden for individuals to identify quick wins or minimal implementations, from long-term benefits or heavy refactoring while encouraging a policy of progress over perfection.</p>
					<p id="impact"><strong><em>Impact:</em></strong></p>
					<dl class="rating">
						<dt>Low</dt><dd>Quick sustainability wins.</dd>
						<dt>Medium</dt><dd>Noticeable sustainable impact.</dd>
						<dt>High</dt><dd>Significant long-term benefit.</dd>
					</dl>
					<p id="effort"><strong><em>Effort:</em></strong></p>
					<dl class="rating">
						<dt>Low</dt><dd>Minimal implementation.</dd>
						<dt>Medium</dt><dd>Some changes are needed.</dd>
						<dt>High</dt><dd>Heavy refactoring is required.</dd>
					</dl>
					<p>For each of the guidelines and success criteria in the WSG document itself, the Interest Group has also documented a wide variety of potential benefits. The benefits are informative and may potentially justify the scope for compliance with the specification.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, for those requiring guidelines to be linked to a standardized methodology that can be used in reporting the digital sustainability conformance levels of a business, a section on GRI compliance is provided.</p>
					<p id="reporting"><strong><em>GRI Impact:</em></strong></p>
					<p>As with impact and effort ratings, a similar scoring methodology has been used within each rating section.</p>
					<dl class="rating">
						<dt>Low</dt><dd>This will have a minimal impact within a particular category.</dd>
						<dt>Medium</dt><dd>This will have an impact worthy of consideration within a particular category.</dd>
						<dt>High</dt><dd>This will have a considerable impact within a particular category.</dd>
					</dl>
					<p class="note">For this specification, an open source <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/GRI.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a> was created. As an input, it takes a spreadsheet containing all the guidelines and (using low, medium, or high) their indicators of impact on the reduction of server resource usage, network transfer, and end-user device usage. Then it takes data from a GreenIT Report [[FOOTPRINT]] which estimates the environmental impact of the mentioned categories across material use, water use, energy use, and <abbr title="Greenhouse Gas">GHG</abbr> emissions. It then combines these datasets and estimates the comparative impact of a given recommendation on different sections of GRI taxonomy.</p>
					<p>Examples (where possible) are provided, comprised of either URL resources or code samples to showcase how a Success Criteria within a guideline could be addressed. Tags are also provided in order to help individuals identify the relationships that occur between our material and particular groups.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Interpretation -->
				<h3>Interpretation</h3>
				<p>It should be noted that the coverage of the Layers of Guidance, with particular emphasis on the impact and effort ratings, may be left open to interpretation, due to the broad and varying nature of how variables can benefit the wider ecosystem. For example, a guideline may have a low impact on preserving water but a high impact on preserving electricity. As such, the nature of benefits is nuanced and may require more in-depth analysis if authors wish to target specific environmental concerns such as water, paper, or mineral waste.</p>
				<p>Currently, the Web Sustainability Guidelines use a crude metric of human assessment from subject-matter experts and a stated calculation and methodology underpinning the GRI reporting. However, future versions of the specification will seek to expand upon this, emphasizing metric-based calculations and proven datasets through measurability to identify emissions (and other) related targets.</p>
				<p>It should also be noted that a drawback of the sustainability sector is that unlike other forms of measurement in other fields (such as web performance and accessibility) where binary conversations can occur (something either "is" or "is not" happening), there is unlikely to be a situation where a product or service is never emitting or causing some sort of impact upon the environment by nature of it existing. As such, implementors need to come to terms with the fact that the aim of the Web Sustainability Guidelines should be to firstly reduce what you can, then for what you cannot (as emissions will likely always occur to some extent) compensate for these continuous emissions to ensure as minimal a footprint as possible.</p>
				<p class="note">Coverage should not be restricted to what falls within the digital sector. While for this specification we primarily focus on Internet-related technologies (and the people and businesses that use them), sustainability variables exist beyond the scope of this work and as such, the impacts of these differing areas of concern should be addressed when meeting targets, reporting, and complying with relevant legislation.</p>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Relationships -->
				<h4>Relationships</h4>
				<div class="note">
					<p>The body of work and landscape WSG builds on is constantly evolving. Some, typically referred to as "living" or "evergreen" standards, are subject to change frequently, and their impact on this publication's validity may be immediate. Others are updated less regularly and the changes may not affect WSG publications until a new revision is issued.</p>
					<p>In all cases, it is therefore prudent that implementors should regularly ensure that best practices have not changed due to new research or data and that any tooling they are using is frequently updated to account for compliance changes occurring as a result of more weighty evidence and guidance.</p>

					<dt>Relationship to <abbr title="Association Française de Normalisation">AFNOR</abbr></dt>
					<dd>Association Française de Normalisation is a Paris-based standards organization and a member body for France at the International Organization for Standardization. WSG directly references the <a href="https://www.boutique.afnor.org/en-gb/standard/afnor-spec-2201//fa203506/323315">AFNOR SPEC 2201</a> document where guidelines may have relatable sustainability associations.</dd>
					<dt>Relationship to ARCEP</dt>
					<dd>The Autorité de Régulation des Communications Électroniques, des Postes et de la Distribution de la Presse is the regulatory authority for telecommunications in France. Explicit comparison notes from guidelines that match (for compliance purposes) pointing to the <a href="https://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/general_policy_framework_for_the_ecodesign_of_digital_services_version_2024.pdf">General Policy Framework for the Ecodesign of Digital Services</a> (<abbr title="General Policy Framework for the Ecodesign of Digital Services">GPFEDS</abbr>) inside each WSG relevant guideline reference section have been provided.</dd>
					<dt>Relationship to AWS and Microsoft Azure WAF</dt>
					<dd><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/">Microsoft Azure</a> both provide a Well-Architected Framework offering a set of best practices that helps protect digital products from consuming excessive resources. Where sustainability measures match the evidence and guidelines within the WSG, cross-links have been placed within guideline resources.</dd>
					<dt>Relationship to <abbr title="Handbook of Sustainable Design of Digital Services">GR491</abbr></dt>
					<dd>The Handbook of Sustainable Design of Digital Services (also known as <a href="https://gr491.isit-europe.org/en/">GR491</a>) is a series of sustainability best practices, published by the Institute for Sustainable IT. Alike many other best practice guides, where matching compliance targets can be found to the WSG guidelines and Success Criteria, cross-links in the resources section have been provided.</dd>
					<dt>Relationship to GreenIT</dt>
					<dd>The <a href="https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices/blob/main/README.en.md">GreenIT 115 best practices of web Eco-Design</a> project is an open source French collaboration to provide meaningful goals to reduce a digital carbon footprint. As there are many parallels between WSG and the open source GreenIT project, guideline references note prior work from this project where it exists.</dd>
					<dt>Relationship to GRI</dt>
					<dd>Global Reporting Initiative is an international independent standards organization that helps organizations and individuals understand and communicate their sustainability impact. As denoted in [[[#additional-information]]], WSG provides metrics relating to <a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/">GRI Standards</a> to offer more targeted guidance for regulatory compliance goals. As our measurability improves, our results are subject to change.</dd>
					<dt>Relationship to OpQuast</dt>
					<dd>OpQuast is a quality assurance provider that offers checklists for things such as <a href="https://checklists.opquast.com/en/web-quality-assurance/">Web quality assurance</a>. While many of the improvements noted fall out of the sustainability scope, several directly relate to WSG Success Criteria or may impact guidelines as a secondary effect and should be considered. As this list is comprehensive, items deemed of consequence are noted in the resources section for relevant guidelines.</dd>
					<dt>Relationship to <abbr title="Sustainable Development Goals">SDGs</abbr></dt>
					<dd>The United Nations Member States in 2015 as a result of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development created the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. While some of these goals are notably difficult to achieve by individual action, wherever digital / Web technology interconnects with an explicit SDG target (and WSG could help shift towards compliance), the SDG target is noted within the references for each guideline.</dd>

			<section class="override" id="conformance"> <!-- Conformance -->
				<h3>Conformance</h3>
				<p>As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative. The main normative content of WSG is composed of guidelines and success criteria, which define requirements that impact conformance claims. Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>
				<p>This section lists requirements for conformance to WSG. It also provides information about how to make optional conformance claims.</p>
				<section> <!-- Requirements -->
					<h4>Conformance requirements</h4>
					<p>The WSG approach to conformance differs from WCAG in that in preference to having conformance levels, these guidelines are robustly built so that they can be implemented over time, in a non-specific order, and each will provide some measurable sustainability benefit. As such, conformance is measured upon the implementation of each guideline (and all of its success criteria being met) across the whole website or product.</p>
					<p class="note">Total conformance is achieved by meeting every Success Criteria for every guideline within the specification. As a general policy, most websites or products will not likely be able to satisfy all Success Criteria. This could be as a result of time commitments for refactoring code, or because certain guidelines and Success Criteria simply do not apply to your work. In these situations, it is not recommended that authors prioritize conformance over other important website features such as security updates. Pragmatism and progress over perfection should be considered paramount when implementing and conforming to these guidelines.</p>
				</section>
				<section> <!-- Claims -->
					<h4>Conformance claims</h4>
					<p>Conformance claims are <strong>not required</strong>. Authors can conform to WSG without making a claim. If a conformance claim is made, then the conformance claim <strong>must</strong> include the following information:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Date</strong> of the claim.</li>
						<li><strong>Guidelines title, version, and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr></strong> "Web Sustainability Guidelines at <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/">https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/</a>".</li>
						<li><strong>Conformance</strong>: A concise description of Sustainability commitments and a list of the guidelines adhered to.</li>
						<li><strong>Other</strong>: In addition to the required components of a conformance claim above, provide additional information to assist visitors such as additional steps taken (beyond the specification) to improve sustainability or statistics (metrics) that show the effect of changes that have already been made.</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="note">Recording conformance claims may be helpful for utilization within a sustainability statement or a method of proving that you are meeting sustainability reduction targets (such as for internal scope accounting).</p>

					<p>In the field of sustainability, the potential for greenwashing (misappropriation or deliberately misinterpreting our work to appear greener than you are) is a very real threat. Within other fields of the tech industry (such as web accessibility), false claims can lead to harm to users. In sustainability, harm can occur not only to users of a product or service but also to the wider ecosystem.</p>
					<p>As such, with claims of conformance, we advise consumers and implementors to do the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do not claim the Web Sustainability Guidelines as a mark of total sustainability (as there will always be gaps in this document's coverage).</li>
						<li>Only make claims that they can reasonably justify with evidence to back up such statements (and provide easy access to this).</li>
						<li>If you come across an organization or individual making claims regarding the WSG that appear unlikely or untrue, request the claims be justified, rectified, or removed.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Legislation exists (or is coming into force globally) providing coverage around sustainability claims and as such, penalties for greenwashing will not only be detrimental to your visitors but to your business.</p>

			<section> <!-- Supporting -->
				<h3>WSG supporting documents</h3>
				<p>The WSG document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical specification. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on this document and address other important purposes, including providing further techniques regarding implementation strategies, guiding authors through the guidelines that apply to their use case, and how WSG would be applied to new technologies.</p>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Requirements -->
				<h3>Requirements for WSG</h3>
				<p>WSG meets a set of requirements for WSG which, in turn, inherit requirements from any prior versions. Requirements structure the overall framework of guidelines and ensure backward compatibility. The Interest Group also used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria which is based on evidence-supported practices grouped by their impact and implementation upon the Web ecosystem. This allows for further expansion in future versions while maintaining a strict grouping of related (and overlapping) guidelines.</p>
			</section>
			<section> <!-- Versions -->
				<h3>Versions of guidance</h3>
				<p>WSG was initiated to improve Web Sustainability guidance. As no prior version exists, the initial draft was created through initial Community Group meetings, proposals (laid out in meeting minutes), and early draft guidelines were drawn up and refined, leading to the guidelines included in this version. This work has been continued through the formation of a W3C Interest Group to enhance and improve upon the work of the early Community Group. The Interest Group considers that WSG incrementally advances Web Sustainability in numerous areas, but underscores that not all potential environmental improvements are met by these guidelines.</p>
				<!--
				<p>WSG 1.X extends WSG 1.X by adding new success criteria, definitions to support them, guidelines to organize the additions, and references for further information. This additive approach helps to emphasize that websites and applications which conform to WSG 1.X also conforms to prior versions, thereby meeting conformance obligations that are specific to earlier specifications. The Interest Group recommends that sites adopt WSG 1.0 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention earlier versions, to provide improved sustainability and to anticipate future policy changes.</p>
				<p>The following guidelines and success criteria are new:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1.3.4 Content</li>

		<section> <!-- User Experience Design -->
			<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
			<p><strong>If you're creating content and systems designed for users, then whether you know it or not, you're working in user experience.</strong></p>
			<p>Good user experience reduces time and (data) resources wasted on the journey. Bad user experience design does the opposite, while potentially also having a negative impact on accessibility. Meanwhile, the aesthetic and visual choices - and how we choose to present information - can have some of the biggest impact on asset size, performance, and overall web sustainability. </p>
			<p>Goals include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and regularly audit product, visitor, and user needs and the related impact.</li>
				<li>Improve ease of access with a clear information architecture.</li>
				<li>Ensure assets are suitable and optimized for the lowest possible footprint.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Benefits include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Good user experience improves the effectiveness of whatever you and your organization are trying to achieve.</li>
				<li>Faster loading times reduce visitor drop-off. This can lead to, for example, more sign-ups and reduced cart abandonment in e-commerce.</li>
				<li>Improved accessibility, compatibility, and usability has greater societal benefits.</li>
				<li>Sustainable user experience design best practices will often also improve performance and SEO.</li>

							<p>When creating a product or service, identifying your target audience through user-research, analytics, data collected using ethical anonymous methods, or feedback from and with visitors is important in being able to create a customized service for and with them that is tailor-made for their specific preferences, adapted for any needs they may have, and particularly useful in helping a website or application evolve its service to meet sustainability targets.</p>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Undertaking analytics or research allows you to customize your product or service based on the needs of your visitor. The benefits of this are that emissions will be reduced due to an experience not making assumptions or developing unnecessary features (wasting resources), and being more specific about how you might reduce a product or service's environmental impact.</li>
								<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Assessing the needs of visitors will help you comply with privacy laws like GDPR, and anonymous analytics alongside test data can also be used to improve privacy.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Improved user experience often means products or services work better for visitors on older devices, in low-bandwidth environments, those with older devices, those in restrictive countries, those who speak different languages, and those with other potential barriers to accessing content. This reduces emissions as less e-waste will be produced if the need for newer equipment becomes less of a priority.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Understanding the needs of your visitors through accessibility and trauma-informed research will help you prioritize which inclusive design improvements need to be implemented to enhance an already accessible product or service.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Identifying what visitors require through research and analytics will reduce the potential for technical debt along the product's lifespan, which will help reduce emissions as developers will spend less time building a product with unnecessary features. It can also be used to identify bottlenecks in the user experience that are causing visitor abandonment. Fixes can be measured and tested against each other, and the benefits of improvements can result in fewer emissions.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Knowing your audience has financial benefits, as they are more likely to purchase your product or service if it meets their requirements. Quantitative data analysis can identify potential cost savings by reducing data payload sizes where optimizations can be made.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> If a product matches an audience's requirements, they will be likely to use it regularly and this will increase its popularity and gain trust, word of mouth, and social standing.</li>

								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> For other potentially marginalized groups, such as those who speak different languages, live in low-bandwidth areas, use older devices, have other barriers to accessing information, and so on, accounting for their needs early in the process will reduce the need for costly redesigns to accompany their requirements later on due to demand (or producing specialist alternative sites to cope with their functionality).</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> By understanding the accessibility communities' requirements in the early stages of a digital project, inclusive design can be prioritized throughout the product or service life-cycle, which will lead to efficiency savings in developer time (due to not having to retrofit accessibility) and fewer emissions from the patching process.</li>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Streamlining a user experience to remove barriers and non-essential items (which eliminates waste from code and content) reduces the amount of time visitors spend on their devices trying to complete tasks or find information. This reduces the amount of energy used and lowers emissions.</li>
								<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Collecting less information by hiding non-essential features will be beneficial for data protection as you can reduce how much information is presented to the visitor and, in turn, how much is exposed to a minimum (if any is needed during the experience).</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Lightweight experiences work better for people with older devices, those who live in low-bandwidth environments, and so on. The benefits for lower-powered devices are that fewer emissions will be generated, as the device's reduced capabilities will often have lower energy requirements.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Intuitive, lightweight user experiences that are easy to understand improve accessibility, especially for people with cognitive disabilities, and will benefit sustainability in terms of less confusion which could impact the time spent on websites trying to find content.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Displaying less information on the screen by reducing the amount of content until it is necessary will naturally reduce bandwidth consumption over the lifecycle of a product or service, and may make an experience feel faster.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Lower data payloads resulting from reducing visitor choices and simplifying an interface by reducing the amount of information can help reduce the burden of choice and convince visitors during the decision-to-purchase process.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Busy websites with too much information laid out haphazardly will lead to confusion and abandonment. Following conventions and patterns with a clean, distraction-free layout will reduce churn, page abandonment, and barriers to entry.</li>

							<p>Time is precious, wasting a visitor's will cause frustration and lead to abandonment or resentment. Additionally, the more time a visitor spends in front of a screen, the more energy they utilize. As such, throwing stuff in front of the visitor vying for their attention might sound like good business (even though we know due to banner blindness it rarely works), but it mostly damages the environment and dissuades the visitor.</p>

								<dt><a href="#effort">Effort</a></dt><dd>Low</dd>
							</dl>
							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Using pagination rather than infinite scrolling allows individuals to request data on demand rather than encouraging overconsumption, thereby reducing their carbon impact by way of using psychology to encourage healthy (and sustainable) browsing habits.</li>
								<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Being open and honest with visitors about their experience and avoiding moving their attention in negative ways will lead to greater trust and the potential for repeat custom.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> By avoiding dark and deceptive patterns and ensuring that the visitor's attention is focused on achieving their aims, you reduce the potential for confusion, mistakes, and lapses in judgment which could lead to consequences for them and the trust they have in your business down the road.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Being aware of accessibility barriers and accounting for them within your processes will allow you to reduce barriers to access and prioritize the availability of information for visitors who may access information using different tooling (such as assistive technology like a screen reader). In doing so you can reduce the additional emissions produced by accessibility tools as visitors can find what they want quicker, and fewer mistakes are likely to be made during a session.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Certain attention-seeking features like notification requests or cookie banners can detract from visitor performance, as time is spent by consumers navigating through methods to close or hide the annoyances. Finding better ways of presenting the information will make an experience feel faster and reduce the barriers to access which trigger a block in the user-flow.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Organizations that monetize visitor attention strive to keep it as long as possible, therefore increasing their product or service's environmental impact. Conversely, organizations that strive to streamline interactions while still meeting visitor's needs (and their own business goals) measurably reduce their product or service's environmental impact, and potentially reach new audiences.</li>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Many deceptive design patterns have visitors wasting time and energy trying to undo choices they never intended to make. Avoiding them therefore reduces energy use.</li>
								<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Many deceptive patterns are intentionally designed to undermine data privacy. Ensuring you comply with ethical privacy practices and avoiding such patterns will avoid potential legal conflicts. You also reduce additional data being sent among the providers of tracking and advertising data.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Dark and deceptive design patterns often intentionally block or hide access to information, which especially undermines the experience of people with disabilities who use assistive technologies. By avoiding them, you will give those with accessibility needs justification to trust your brand. Furthermore, avoiding unsustainable or carbon-intensive implementations will prevent making any existing situations worse.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Interference with the user-interface (such as removing the ability to copy text) causes unnecessary friction and forces the visitor to spend more time on the page to work around the barrier put in place. This uses additional energy as they try to find a solution onsite, elsewhere, or give up entirely. Using ethical, non-disruptive coding practices will speed up interactions within your website.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Ethical websites incentivize customers to whitelist your website on ad blockers.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Avoiding dark and deceptive patterns will likely result in fewer complaints. A classic example of this is the use of CAPTCHAs which can disrupt the visitor, cause accessibility barriers, and reduce the legitimate use of your product or service.</li>

							<p>Design systems allow common components and patterns to be formalized and managed within a website or application. By using such a tool, designers and developers can avoid reinventing existing tooling and thereby reduce wasted time (and emissions).</p>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Consistent interfaces that employ web standards require less energy and resources across the product ecosystem, as they are usually tightly optimized. Also, design systems that incorporate environmental criteria can help to scale digital sustainability across the enterprise and reduce redundancy within code, resulting in collectively reduced energy use and impact.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> A design system with standardized, lightweight components will improve access to information for people in low-bandwidth areas, on older devices, and so on. Also, design systems will reduce the chance of biases that could affect such groups being introduced.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> A design system with accessible components will improve access to information for people with disabilities. Building design features with accessibility baked in by default reduces the potential that people with accessibility requirements will be left out during the website or application's lifecycle.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Design Systems are built using standardized components that reduce the churn of repeat coding, thereby reducing developer coding turnarounds and, as a byproduct, improve performance and reduce emissions during the process. This will inherently reduce emissions considerably through the building of sustainable patterns.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Because of their use of standardized components and their avoidance of redundancy, design systems reduce costs as the development time may be reduced (even accounting for the maintenance time involved in having one). Also, familiar-looking websites that can be browsed with ease are likely to suffer lower bounce rates (where visitors just give up) due to the ease of transition (unlike a unique-looking website which can make navigation increasingly complex).</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Design Systems encourage using recognizable components throughout a design, which will help visitors identify and utilize the product or service successfully. As such, this will reduce complaints and annoyance, which can help increase customer retention. Also, user-interface consistency improves visitor trust as individuals will recognize familiar components within your design and know how to utilize them, and this can improve conversion rates as it will lower the rates of abandonment.</li>

							<p>Video and audio-heavy websites are often those that can have significant sustainability costs in terms of storage and carbon intensity for viewers who have to process the media with their devices to watch them (draining batteries). Optimizing such assets as much as possible is critical for a sustainable product or service.</p>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Media assets like audio and video can be very resource-hungry. Reducing battery-draining events such as loading high-effort content until the moment it is required can have savings in terms of pure processing and displaying of the media.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Providing alternatives to bandwidth-hungry media will assist those unable to benefit due to their environment.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Delivering media assets in ways that convey information in an easy-to-perceive manner both visually and contextually (even if people are unable to for example see), will allow a wider audience to gain from your content.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Catering your experience to the device, situation, and environment of the visitor will reduce wasted bandwidth (for example, sending a lower resolution for less capable devices). As such, the data savings will translate into a performance boost for those taking advantage of the reduced capabilities.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Being able to avoid media entirely and rely on options such as transcripts will provide huge financial rewards for those who pay for the bandwidth they consume or serve.</li>

								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Animation can be resource intensive. It can utilize both the CPU and GPU, consume a vast amount of RAM, and take a while to render. This is without considering the accessibility and usability issues it contains. By taking all of this into account, allowing the disabling or reduction of animation can be environmentally beneficial.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Individuals from different nations and backgrounds may have differing views on the use of animation, and different devices may support different levels of technology. As such, catering to many viewpoints will ensure the widest possible audience.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Animation that flashes can potentially trigger seizure conditions such as epilepsy; therefore it is critically important that you avoid any hazards within your designs.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Compressing, removing, or otherwise reducing animation files improves performance as less syntax will exist within your product or service codebase.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Subtle animation can draw the visitor's eye to useful information that could assist you to financial success, but this must be done ethically, and without overdoing it.</li>

								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> System-level (Web Safe) fonts work across the widest range of devices and platforms, which improves access to information for those who may have tightly regulated browsing habits or limited availability.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> By providing Web fonts that are optimized but optional, visitors can experience the product or service with a level of speed versus aesthetic they feel comfortable with.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> While pretty, custom typefaces are entirely optional on the Web and, as such, the bandwidth they consume (and the emissions this produces) are unnecessary.

							<p>Media, images, fonts, and documents enrich the Internet. The problem is that people may not want to watch a video, listen to an audio file, look at an image, or use a specific application. By providing alternative formats to anything you embed, you ensure the widest possible audience can benefit from it (and reduced carbon output will occur as the alternative text will induce less consumer hardware thrashing than its rich media alternative).</p>

								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Certain accessibility barriers can prevent media from being consumed, as such it's important to offer different ways of viewing a site's content.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Reducing the interactivity of a website doesn't mean a lesser experience, it can help visitors access what they need quicker.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Media is costly to produce and host, text is cheap and takes little data to download, it can help reduce your hosting costs to serve a media-free setting within pages.</li>

							<p>It is important to automate measurements of page speed, time-to-first-byte, and page score to verify recent changes didn't increase these metrics. Automatic threshold alerts or anomalies on metrics help indicate regression. Identify target "page weight budgets" to help establish a baseline. Popular performance tools like Google Lighthouse can help too. Similarly, environmental metrics can be measured or assessed and evaluated against thresholds defined in a sustainability budget.

							<p>Compatibility is a critical part of the sustainability mindset and should be prioritized through all products and services. If individuals wish to use older devices (or cannot upgrade due to cost) or do not wish to upgrade as frequently, it will reduce the amount of e-waste that enters the system. If something doesn't work, it's also likely to result in visitors suffering a wasted effort, potentially leading to refused access to your service (and thereby emitting further emissions).</p>

							</dl>
							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Incompatible websites and applications across the Web encourage people to purchase new devices, which has a giant impact on the environment due to the amount of e-waste it produces. Additionally, planned obsolescence is one of the biggest contributors to e-waste on the planet. Extending the lifespan and improving digital device compatibility within your site's service plan, can improve sustainability and slow the upgrade cycle which results from sluggish digital experiences.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> More compatible products and services that last longer helps to reduce the digital divide, which can be a key issue in cases where income inequality, infrastructure robustness, and other factors play their part (and open your work to new markets). Similarly, because progressive web applications use established web standards, they are available to more people than more cost-prohibitive closed systems (Apple App Store, Google Play, etc).</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The fourth pillar of Accessibility is robustness. By incorporating accessibility into early prototypes, it becomes a priority for project teams throughout a product's lifecycle. Broken source code can also (in specific cases) impact assistive technologies (such as screen readers) and how they can read content to individuals with visual disabilities. Ensuring semantic code can provide an equal, error-free experience to all.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Incompatible code has an energy cost, when it's non-standard, deprecated or doesn't work on a device it can take additional time to render as it is usually un-optimized for the environment, which will put pressure on the CPU and waste the consumer's battery. Using modern Web standards will help your website run fast in modern browsers.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Product teams benefit from time savings and improved quality, organizations see cost reductions as less refactoring is required due to increased stability, and users benefit from greater trust and potentially lower product costs and maintenance fees as upgrades may not be required as frequently.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> More compatible products and services that last longer can potentially increase conversion rates due to the lower rates of abandonment and a wider market audience that can use a barrier-free version of the product or service.</li>

							<p>This approach is applicable across various programming languages and platforms, both client-side and server-side. By modularizing code and assets, you can ensure faster load times, better resource management, reduce redundancy, and improved scalability for your application. Additionally, reducing unnecessary data transfer and optimizing load times can contribute to more energy-efficient operations, helping to lower the environmental impact, improve the UX of your web application or service.</p>

							<p>Redundancy is the enemy of sustainability. Having systems in place to ensure that everyone can work from established patterns, the website or application remains clean and easy to use, and iteration over redesign is firmly in the mindset that will help promote sustainable practices. It's also worth being wary of abstracting code too early (see <abbr title="Avoid Hasty Abstractions">AHA</abbr> methodology) or incorrectly, as while good abstractions can be more efficient, poor ones can waste effort and introduce complexity, bloat, and bugs to your codebase which can lead to emissions.</p>

					<p>Third-party products, services, libraries, and frameworks are often a source of sustainability issues that cannot be controlled or managed by the first-party provider of a service. While many do provide benefits to a website, the need to justify their inclusion must be made not only by those creating the product or service but also be able to be controlled by the consumer.

							<p>Whether advertising, chatbots, maps, or other tooling; outsourcing your service to a third-party provider may be potentially useful in certain scenarios in reducing design or development time and redundancy (which can be a win for sustainability). Third-party services, however, come with issues, such as the lack of control over emissions, and they often can potentially suffer from latency and large file sizes which may not exist if you self-hosted or created the material.</p>

								<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Visitors not interested in embedded content may identify the lack of third-party tracking (such as embedded pixels and tags) as a privacy benefit, as there are fewer chances that visitor data is exploited.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Self-made widgets and controls work much faster than third-party content as you don't have to perform additional server requests, rendering requests, and such.

								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Semantic HTML is a great stepping stone towards making your content easier to navigate by assistive technologies. Many tags within HTML come with pre-loaded context about what is expected within them (reducing the need for ARIA or other descriptive features). This can also help browsers, search engines, social networks, and other "blind" technologies understand your websites or applications better.

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Intent</strong></p>
							<p>The ability to work around render-blocking issues is a great addition to the web. From deferring code, to lazy loading, to asynchronous loading, each has its use case and each can have the potential to reduce or give performance benefits to a website or application.</p>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Lazy loading videos and images ensures that they are only requested once the visitor needs them (not demanded even if they aren't viewed). This saves processing power which can help older devices or those with less battery capacity access your websites and applications barrier-free.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Letting text render first makes your website feel like it's loading faster (as the remainder will appear in the background or on demand).</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Unused content will not contribute to your server's bandwidth bills.</li>

							<p>Helping visitors avoid wasting their time can reduce the number of emissions from time spent in front of a screen. As such, by using existing technologies like metadata, robots.txt files, and accessibility-friendly aids within the page, improvements to the experience can be made.</p>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> People spend a lot of time searching for the information they want, and helping them get there quicker will reduce the drain on their device battery.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Paradoxically as it may seem, the concept of getting people to spend more time on your website is not often beneficial. Visitors often want to accomplish a task and move on, yet we put great effort into keeping them on-site (time-wasting). This is a dark pattern that has consequences for sustainability (consumption of resources) and potentially the visitor's health and well-being.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Skip links and other aids can accelerate a visitor's journey through your website, reducing the system resources their tooling requires, and assist them in finding the content they need.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Finding information quickly is a perceived performance. It may not physically reduce the data transferred, but it will help reduce the steps required to achieve a goal; thus, the time on-screen is lessened.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Quick visits may encourage repeat custom when the visitor has limited spare time.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> A well-mapped website will index properly in search engines, leading to a good page rank.</li>

							<p>Sustainability benefits can be generated in numerous ways, by making sure that your website adheres to the requests made by a browser for specific conditions to be taken into account (such as CSS media and preference queries), you can unlock benefits for the visitor, and as a by-product reduce your emissions. It's worth noting that the introduction of user preferences and APIs has increased the risk of visitor fingerprinting and privacy issues.</p>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Improving the experience for monochrome devices (using a monochrome preference query) could encourage more visitors to use these energy-efficient eInk devices. For OLED displays dark mode (prefers-color-scheme) will be more energy efficient. Animation and media have a significant impact on CPU and GPU, therefore reducing its usage (prefers-reduced-motion) will reduce energy usage. Finally, having a print-friendly stylesheet will save not only paper but also ink wastage.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Media queries don't tell individuals how to experience the web, they follow the preferences of the visitor or a device's capabilities.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Having a high contrast (prefers-contrast) version of a site will reduce the barriers to entry and time wasted for visually impaired visitors. Less motion may also assist people with accessibility requirements.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Allowing visitors to have a Lo-Fi (prefers-reduced-data) version of a site could significantly reduce the carbon footprint they emit (which for individuals on a data plan would be beneficial). Additionally, by detecting if scripting is disabled and offering alternative content, you could save wasted effort and improve the performance of a product or service.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Print media queries (or stylesheets) can save visitors additional ink and paper costs.</li>

This should include using situational design to reduce the codebase disable non-essential functionality during high-intensity periods or adapting the user-interface to perform better in situations where scaling hardware resources can be avoided to reduce emissions. It can also include designing algorithms that can auto-disable features based on set thresholds.</p>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Intent</strong></p>
							<p>Visitors approach our products and services on a wide variety of devices these days. Ensuring that your device works on the widest range of devices and differing screen resolutions ensures that you will have a compatible website or application. A Device-Adaptable approach goal is to provide a consistent, adaptable experience across a full range of devices by considering all screen sizes and resolutions from the start, rather than primarily focusing on mobile scaling upward.</p>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Image optimization, minification, and efficient resource loading can improve performance and provide a streamlined experience for visitors. Additionally, smaller devices are often more underpowered than larger devices, so any hardware optimization could benefit both the user and the environment. Using less energy to power screens, for example, by adopting "Dark Mode or Dark Background," can also offer many benefits.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Low-powered devices are frequently used in developing nations, but ensuring that content works for older devices is paramount.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Mobile websites usually incorporate large, touch-friendly buttons, simplified navigation menus, and clear readable fonts. This often makes it easier for individuals with visual or motor impairments to interact with than a traditional desktop layout and could prove to be beneficial for certain visitors to take advantage of. A device-adaptable Strategy (considering approach limitations) maximizes accessibility and usability across all devices, enhancing accessibility and ensuring an optimized experience by reducing the need for users to adapt their experience to device-specific limitations.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Using lazy-loading and other delayed rendering techniques can boost website speed for small visual capacity devices.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Ensuring that your website or application works across not only desktop devices but also smartphones and other unique screen resolutions can benefit you financially as it allows individuals to make purchases while on the move (which can be more convenient), while potentially using little or no screen.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Products and services that work well across a wider range of platforms and devices can encourage a wider audience to use your website or application not only in one situation but in many you might not have envisaged.</li>

							<p>Websites should include a range of expected and standard beneficial files to improve search engine optimization, user experience, transparency, and overall site health. Search engines and browsers regularly request these files by default. If they don't exist, this leads to unnecessary requests, potential errors, and increased emissions. Including these files avoids these issues while also providing SEO, user experience, and other benefits. They each have a low carbon footprint, so while they do create emissions, it's worth including them for the benefits they provide.</p>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Search engines or browsers request certain files by default, ensuring they are in place will reduce loading errors, and may provide efficiency enhancements in how visitors find or interact with a site. Plaintext requires no rendering. If visitors (or search engines) know about these useful files (like carbon.txt) they can load quicker and with less CPU / GPU impact than any HTML website.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> OpenSearch.xml enables the browser's default search box rather than a custom solution to be integrated with your website search, which may aid accessibility as it encourages the use of a browser native component (and / or keyboard shortcuts) rather than a website or application which may suit certain accessibility requirements better.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Files that are expected will produce HTTP requests, ensuring they are met will satisfy the products making them and potentially reduce the requests once they are discovered. Plaintext files contain no links, no markup, and have no imprint. Putting credits (for example) in such a file will reduce data transfer and have a lower rendering footprint.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Robots.txt and Sitemap files can be utilized by search engines to help make your website more findable, this could lead to more visitors and potentially more customers as a result. The ads.txt file is part of a scheme to reduce advertising fraud, it could be useful.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Robots.txt can be used to target specific search engines, helping to ensure content is correctly indexed to get a good placement so that visitors can find you easily.</li>
								<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The humans.txt file provides credit to people involved in a site's creation, and security offers critical points of contact if an issue is discovered. Both are valuable additions to a project.</li>

					<p>Identify the requirements and from this, choose the implementation of the product or service. A simpler technological implementation may use more human resources but could have a smaller footprint. A prebuilt solution may use more system resources (and thereby produce more emissions upon render) but have a faster build-time (emitting less carbon during development).</p>

					<p>As a general rule, coding from scratch is the best-performing methodology (though if an existing solution is actively maintained, it may be better optimized than what you could produce).

					<p>If choosing a code generation tool, use a Static Site Generator in preference to a bulky content management system. Because <abbr title="Static Site Generators">SSGs</abbr> often start using a minimalist content entry format (like markdown) and all of the compilation is done before the website is uploaded, the emissions benefit comes from the server not having to place as much effort into serving pages (as they are static) for each visitor.

			<h2>Hosting, Infrastructure, and Systems</h2>
			<p><strong>Even data has a home. Whether you're developing tools, processing data, maintaining online systems, operating websites or something else - conscious choices in this area can have an enormous impact.</strong></p>
			<p>Sustainable or green web hosting, infrastructure, and systems covers the energy sources our data centers use, but it ultimately goes much further: It'd also about where and what data is processed or stored and the technologies used. Conscious provisioning choices and best practices can improve both sustainability and operational efficiency.</p>
			<p>Goals include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Find sustainable providers for hosting, CDNs, and other third-party solutions.</li>
				<li>Adjust back-end settings to ensure proper caching, compression, and error handling.</li>
				<li>Ensure your processes reflect best practices to maximize efficiency and sustainability.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Benefits include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Efficient, sustainable hosting, infrastructure, and systems can create new marketing opportunities for your business: impressing green-minded or privacy-driven customers.</li>
				<li> Similarly, reducing client device entry requirements may allow you to expand your services to include those using less advanced client devices.</li>
				<li>Lower abandonment rates thanks to optimized code on both the client and server-side means fewer errors, less downtime, and better user experience.</li>
				<li>Gain economic benefits in the form of reduced hardware investment and/or operational expenses and lower maintenance costs thanks to better processes and appropriate provisioning of resources.</li>

							<p>Browser caching reduces the requirement for files to need to be constantly reloaded from the server, and in certain situations, it can even allow for files to be viewed offline (or in the case of a reverse proxy, send immediate recurring requests without additional calculation or computation from the server). As such, this will have sustainability and performance benefits (for instance by greatly reducing Time-To-First-Byte).</p>

					<p>Web browsing from bots has been steadily increasing in recent years. As such, it is a growing concern for security, performance, and sustainability. Use security tools that automatically block bad actors and minimize bad behavior. This results in substantially less load on the server, fewer logs, less data, less effect due to compromise, and more. The result of compromised websites is a large increase in HTTP, email, and other traffic as malicious code attempts to infiltrate other resources and exfiltrate data. Compromised websites are typically identified by anomalous patterned behavior.</p>

							<p>For security reasons and in accordance with a Service-Level Agreement (<abbr title="Service-Level Agreement">SLA</abbr>), it is often recommended to duplicate data to make sure it remains available if a problem occurs. This should be balanced with the cost of such duplication. Not all data is critical and, rather than overcompensating with multiple saves, duplication should be designed with efficiency in mind.</p>

							<p>Depending on carbon intensity, some processes and communications should be delayed and sometimes batched. Redundancy should be avoided wherever possible.

			<h2>Business Strategy and Product Management</h2>
			<p><strong>Websites and applications can be designed and enhanced for better sustainability. This requires good business Strategy and product management, but impact can be had at any level.</strong></p>
			<p>Anyone who owns, manages, or operates a website or application has significant capacity to improve both the sustainability footprint and handprint of their organization. Business owners and other C-level executives are likely to be the main people responsible for the most impactful strategic decisions an organization can make. But all individuals working online can still make a big difference. Work in this area can improve the sustainability of various non-technical considerations that stretch beyond or affect a digital product or service.</p>
			<p>Goals include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use your influence to ensure projects are developed more sustainably, at scale, across organizations of different sizes.</li>
				<li>Raise awareness while publicly disclosing and reporting on your efforts.</li>
				<li>Support your organization from within to ensure it and its staff are better able to meet relevant targets.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Benefits include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Proper evaluation and reporting make it easier to meet compliance targets, apply with legislation, and avoid the risk of potential lawsuits.</li>
				<li>Transparency about your sustainability impact can improve public perception of your company. This can boost customer loyalty and staff retention alike - reducing associated costs.</li>
				<li>Clear policies and continuity planning build trust in your organization, while providing the opportunity to identify quantifiable risks and include relevant stakeholders.</li>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Intent</strong></p>
							<p>Create a publicly available statement in an easy-to-find location on your website that outlines a clear commitment to prioritize ethics and sustainability PPP standards that align with the organization's mission, vision, and values and include statements specific to digital products, services, policies, and programs. This should be done while actively promoting such efforts (with evidence) using social channels.</p>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> A clear sustainability statement should make it easier to align organizational policies and practices with measurable metrics to support goals. And, if included early in digital product Strategy, can benefit from improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact.</li>
								<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> By trying to reduce your emissions, and explaining to a wider audience how you aim to keep your sustainability promises, you can also highlight other key areas of visitor value as ethically important, such as privacy and security (which will gain visitor trust in your brand).</li>
								<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> A clear, public-facing set of policies helps internal and external stakeholders better understand an organization's commitments.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Highlighting intersectional social issues in documentation, storytelling, and marketing materials raises awareness of both problems and potential solutions.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Prioritizing inclusive design both in user-interfaces and storytelling raises awareness of accessibility barriers, improves experience for people with disabilities, and will reduce emissions by reducing barriers to access which may trigger wasted traffic.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Transparent communication on how an organization shares the economic benefits of its digital work raises awareness of social inequalities. Similarly, helping visitors make more informed decisions can support a more financially sustainable product or service overall. A clear statement of intent will also make it easier for the company to measure and report on its impact efforts.</li>
								<li><strong>Operations:</strong> Product teams are more engaged in the work they're doing.</li>

								<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> They will maintain intersectional data privacy standards and potentially watch out for legal compliance issues within the organization.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> A representative will help to reduce the digital divide and improve access to information for visitors with older devices, in low-bandwidth areas, and so on. This reduces emissions as less e-waste will be produced if the need for newer equipment becomes less of a priority.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The sustainability representative will help the organization improve issues surrounding barriers to access. These inherently could cost bandwidth, have a monetary value, and have potential legal implications.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> A dedicated resource who maintains quality control will ultimately improve the organization's financial standing.</li>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Intent</strong></p>
							<p>An Impact Business Model enables an organization to incorporate specific impact initiatives into one or more business models for generating revenue, often making them "green by default" and folding impact initiatives into the organization's operating system. Moreover, being able to calculate the return on investment in terms of sustainability your product or service will bring is important to identifying whether it poses a net-positive or net-negative effect on the environment.</p>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Business models based on advertisement, sponsorship, or the selling of products can be contradictory to some guidelines as they tend to increase the time spent using a product or service. Taking decisions not only based on financial indicators but on benefiting the visitor and the wider ecosystem can help prevent this and reduce overall emissions.</li>
								<li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Adding social indicators (such as the shared value within digital services) can prevent negative social impacts such as impoverishment or exploitation.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Organizations that implement these practices create positive social and environmental impacts with every sale of a product or service. These practices also make it easier for the organization to track and measure progress over time. Understanding and incorporating shared value into a digital product or service can also improve trust, which often leads to improved financial considerations.</li>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Intent</strong></p>
							<p>The organization has policies and practices in place to embrace experimentation, foster a growth mindset, support organizational agility, and provide continuous improvement. Product creators should iterate, regularly, though never at the cost of getting things done (such as working on larger, long-term features).</p>

							<p class="subtitle"><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Focusing on continuous improvement reduces waste and energy use by iteratively identifying opportunities to improve the product or service.</li>
								<li><strong>Operations:</strong> A culture of experimentation fosters more innovation. This supports team-building and improves overall organizational resilience and efficiency.</li>
								<li><strong>Security:</strong> Products or services that are maintained and updated over time reduce risk and improve security.</li>
								<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Having a high-quality, regularly kept up-to-date product or service will reduce the chances of a data breach, which will in turn increase the privacy potential of the website or application.</li>
								<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Iteration is important for inclusive design as different visitors will have different needs, and no two individuals are alike. As such, being agile and adaptable will benefit authors in expanding their accessibility.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Technical debt is reduced if review processes exist. Focusing on continuous improvement rather than large single-scale releases, bottlenecks in a website or application's speed can be resolved quickly as they become apparent. This is especially useful as new releases of Web browsers can alter the performance of products and services.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Agility and continuous improvement help an organization be more resilient in the face of disruption and a changing climate. Long-term, these practices save the organization time, money, and resources. They also provide security benefits that decrease risk and can potentially reduce emissions.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> If a website or application renders correctly, it will naturally encourage more trust with its visitors, and thereby have the potential for repeat custom.</li>

							<ul class="benefits">
								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Maintaining an intuitive, lightweight user experience while adding new features or updating software reduces frustration, churn, and the energy visitors expend when the interface doesn't perform in ways visitors expect.</li>
								<li><strong>Security:</strong> Websites and applications that maintain an evergreen status often have fewer issues due to a strong release cycle which not only makes necessary changes but also keeps visitors informed, maintaining transparency.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Maintaining an optimized user experience that is regularly kept current using best practices also implies that pages and assets load quickly in ways visitors expect.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Products and services which are left to become outdated may have higher costs to restart the project from scratch and resurrect; whereas small regular updates have a lesser overhead in terms of time commitments from development scheduling and the impact on potential lost consumers.</li>

								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> Many products or services keep unnecessary data and functionalities alive while they are not used or useful anymore. Planning for end-of-life reduces their long-term environmental impact by eliminating waste and allowing the freed-up resources to be utilized for other information.</li>
								<li><strong>Security:</strong> Regular maintenance, updates, and care on outdated software and data can significantly reduce security risks.</li>
								<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Incorporating clear end-of-life policies that include a visitor's right to be forgotten will benefit the visitor by explaining how you enforce data protection and comply with legislation.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Removing unnecessary features, functions, and data of a service improves performance and resilience as the resources which were utilizing data will be better spent on more popular functionality, and the gains made from their elimination will be felt in terms of emissions through saved development time.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Removing redundancy in the product or service can generate savings in hosting, security costs, and other third-party subscriptions.</li>

								<li><strong>Environment:</strong> A strict sustainability or performance budget will reduce the chance of your website getting too large (and causing pollution transfers), which in turn will ensure it has a minimal impact on a visitor's device. This will have a direct impact on emissions reduction by forcing businesses to choose where to make reductions and efficiency savings.</li>
								<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Keeping realistic goals regarding delivery size will push developers to optimize resource-heavy projects and reconsider using large tooling in place of lightweight alternatives. Moreover, A lower set target budget for a product or service will decrease the amount of time a browser spends transferring and rendering data.</li>
								<li><strong>Economic:</strong> Customers will not have to keep upgrading devices to match the needs of a website that grows (unchecked) over time.</li>
								<li><strong>Conversion:</strong> Reduced churn and page abandonment will occur due to the application or website becoming more performant. Potentially, your search engine ranking may perform better due to performance being a key indicator in PageRank algorithms.</li>

			<h2>Considerations</h2>
			<p>Guidelines within this specification which the Interest Group has identified possible implications for accessibility, privacy, or security, either by providing protections for end users or which are important for website providers to take in to consideration when implementing features designed to implement digital sustainability, are listed below. This list reflects the current understanding of the Interest Group but other guidelines may have implications that the Interest Group is not aware of at the time of publishing.</p>
			<p>Individuals or organizations wishing to understand more about best practices relating to these objectives should read the relevant materials provided by <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/">W3C Working and Interest Groups</a> in this area, as the result of good accessibility, privacy, and security, can benefit both people and the planet in measurable ways.</p>
			<p>It is relevant to note that groups working on accessibility, privacy, and security may identify sustainability impacts within their work and may provide relevant guidance where appropriate on best practices to limit the scope of these concerns. Any such guidance should be considered as complementary to that provided within the WSG.</p>

					<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Web accessibility</a> (within the context of Inclusive Design) means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities (and those without) can use them, free of barriers.</p>
					<p class="note">Types of accessibility barriers can include auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual. They can also be permanent, temporary, or situational (depending on the situation).</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><dfn data-lt="PPP approach">PPP</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Planet, People, and Prosperity (PPP) is a set of principles that recommends considering each of these factors during the sustainability process.</p>
					<p>This method of considering both people and the planet (alongside the needs of business) is known under other abbreviations with similar objectives such as Environmental, Social, and (corporate) Governance (<abbr title="Environment, Social, Governance">ESG</abbr>), which considers economic variables alongside; there is also Environment, Equity, and Economy (<abbr title="Environment, Equity, Economy">EEE</abbr>) that follow a similar pattern.</p>
					<div class="note">
						<p>Such work is grounded within the three pillars of sustainability:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Planet:</strong> We prioritize the health of the environment, ecosystems, and the planet overall.</li>
							<li><strong>People:</strong> People should have access to resources, information, and opportunities necessary for their well-being.</li>
							<li><strong>Prosperity:</strong> Financial stability and equitable economic development—in this case, through the digital economy—ensures shared prosperity for the planet and its inhabitants.</li>

				<dd>
					<p>An approach to designing <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">digital products and services</a> that puts <a href="https://humanewebmanifesto.com/">people and the planet</a> first.</p>
					<p class="note">Aiming for a clean (hosted using renewables), efficient (using the fewest resources possible), open (accessible and user-controlled data), honest (avoiding misleading or exploiting visitors), regenerative (support people and the planet), and resilient (function under any circumstances) service or product.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Visitors</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Within the context of this specification:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>A visitor is an individual who may visit a website but not necessarily use or interact with (in a measurable way) the products or services provided by the provider.</li>
						<li>A user is an individual who visits a website or application but also uses and interacts with the features provided (whether or not information is exchanged).</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="note">In many cases, visitor and user on the web are used interchangeably (and this is perfectly acceptable), but we have chosen to make this distinction to provide context that in certain cases, individuals (for privacy reasons or simply because certain users just glancing or certain websites having static content) may not be classified as a user (in the sense of a customer) as they are a window shopper (visitor).</p>
