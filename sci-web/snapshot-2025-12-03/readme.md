> **A specification addressing the challenges of measuring website carbon emissions**

Created and managed by the [Software Standards Working Group](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software-standards-wg) in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).

## Scope

The purpose of this proposed specification is to assist web practitioners and developers, designers, architects, and decision-makers in understanding and reducing the carbon footprint of web applications. By making informed choices about architecture, performance optimization, and deployment strategies, practitioners can minimize emissions while maintaining user experience.

We will develop a methodology for calculating the carbon emissions rate (SCI score) of web applications, providing standardized functional units and clear boundaries between web applications and other domains (APIs, SaaS, AdTech). This specification aims to provide a reliable, consistent, and comparable measure that practitioners can use to set targets and track progress in reducing carbon emissions across the entire web stack from client devices through networking to server infrastructure.
