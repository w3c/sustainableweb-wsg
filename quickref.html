					<label><input type="checkbox"><span>Make access as simple and efficient as possible. Displaying the time required to complete an action, reducing choice, and ensuring users understand requirements at the start of a journey can improve user efficiency.</span></label>
					<label><input type="checkbox"><span>Ensure user journeys are as smooth as possible. It also helps to build on established design patterns that people already understand.</span></label>
					<label><input type="checkbox"><span>Enable users to complete tasks without distractions or non-essential features getting in the way.</span></label>
					<label><input type="checkbox"><span>Only present information that is relevant to the user. Do not present non-essential information until requested by the user, and do so in ways appropriate to the accessibility requirements of different users.</span></label>
					<label><input type="checkbox"><span>Ensure that disruptive actionable information, such as pop-up or modal windows, can only be initiated by the user.</span></label>
					<label><input type="checkbox"><span>Use decorative design only when it enhances user experience. Remove unnecessary assets or those that do not enhance user experience or sustainability. Alternatively, make these optional and disabled by default.</span></label>
