## Collaboration

We welcome fresh contributions and understand that this may pose difficulties for those either unfamiliar with pull requests (on a technical level) or with collaborative efforts (wishing to discuss progress before submitting results). In such cases, contributors can (if they choose) work with any open format they prefer to collaborate using (referring to the guidelines and its supplements), and submit an issue request containing the URL to the document in question. The editor will work alongside the group chairs to translate these requested updates into the guidelines.

## File Structure

The structure of the repository has been created to ensure ease of maintenance. The base directory contains living editions of the [guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/), [at-a-glance](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/glance.html), [introduction](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/intro.html), [laws and policies](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/policies.html), [quick reference](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/quickref.html), [STAR](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/star.html), [WSG JSON API](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/guidelines.json), [STAR API](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/star.json), and other deliverables such as our test suite.

You will notice duplication within the content of our work (as the JSON APIs for example must reflect the guidelines). This work is not currently auto-generated so while we appreciate it if individuals go to the effort to make adjustments to all affected files as required, time commitments may not allow for everyone to do so. As such, if you can only update a single document, as part of the approval process, a chair or editor will update all necessary documents to ensure parity with your change.

## Pull Requests

If you would like to contribute towards the guidelines, our primary method is through Pull Requests (PRs).

Pull requests (PRs) should be made against the main branch.

If you are not the sole contributor, please identify all fellow contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.

Once a PR has been reviewed (for quality control purposes), it will either be accepted, or rejected, or further editorial/discussion will be required before it can be progressed. Once a PR has been accepted it will be visible within the living documents immediately. Release notes will be generated by the editor who will verify all submissions before publication.

## Issues

If you cannot submit a pull request, the preferred method is to create a [new issue](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/new) with your comments or solutions. You can also comment on existing issue threads on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/).

You can provide comments on technical errors (bugs) you have uncovered, new guidelines or success criteria you believe should be added, questions you have about existing or future content or an idea for a direction or feature we could / should utilize.

Please check that your question hasn't already been posted first and provide as much detail as possible. We're all volunteers so please keep this in mind and try to be civil when commenting about our work.

## Credit

All contributors will receive credit (in the guidelines and our GitHub release notes) if their contributions make it into the document. Certain exclusions will apply such as those who do not provide their full names or those whose feedback is deemed as invalid, duplicate, or general questions that don't add to the guidelines or other deliverables.
