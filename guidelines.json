							"Economic": "Reducing resource requirements means users will not have to keep upgrading devices to match the needs of digital products and services that are otherwise growing unchecked over time.",
							"Environment": "Setting a strict sustainability or performance budget will reduce the chance of a digital product or service getting too large or resulting in pollution transfers, which will also ensure it has a minimal impact on a user's device. This has a direct impact on emissions by forcing businesses to choose where to make reductions and efficiency savings. Users not having to upgrade devices as frequently will also reduce e-waste from discarded devices.",
							"Performance": "Keeping realistic goals regarding delivery size will push developers to optimize resource-heavy projects and reconsider using large tooling in place of lightweight alternatives. A lower target budget for a product or service will also decrease the amount of time spent transferring and rendering data.",
							"Social Equity": "By having a human or planetary budget, you can assign targets to improve services for impacted groups or those affected directly by your project."
