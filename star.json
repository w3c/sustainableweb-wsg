This will help ensure continuity of service and if a backup or alternative can be offered, provide a way of reducing wasted resources attempting to keep reloading the non-functioning feature.",
							"2": "Machine testing for how users are kept informed and provided with alternative methods of interacting with the product or service could be through the use of a third-party provider that takes the slack when the first-party becomes unavailable, the use of archived material (identified by the content) could also be an indicator or the content provided on some kind of automatically updating channel that lists ongoing issues."

							"1": "[System status pages](https://www.githubstatus.com/) can be a useful customer metric for keeping up-to-date with ongoing issues and reducing the burden of customer support if something widespread happens to a product or service. It does produce reliance on a third-party but its sustainability benefits relate to the business governance and the data from the product can feed into improving ideation which can include improving all-round sustainability."
