		<p>As a sustainably minded organization, we are committed to meeting the WSG.</p>
		<p>As such, we have budgeted to conform to a minimum of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>25% of the specification within 12 months (1 year)</li>
			<li>50% within 24 months (2 years)</li>
			<li>100% within 36 months (3 years)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This will include meeting all Success Criteria and establishing measured ESG savings to improve the sustainability of our products and services.</p>
		<p>Test passes if a sustainability budget is defined with established goals.</p>
