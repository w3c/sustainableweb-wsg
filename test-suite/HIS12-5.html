		<h1>Sustainability Statement</h1>
		<p>Not only does our website comply with the WSG, but our hosting uses 100% renewable energy and we have controls in place so that you can manage log storage on your account and thus reduce a build-up of excess files (and older material can be set to archive in bundles to further reduce space-wastage for when retention policies require long-life holding of logs.</p>
		<p>Test passes if the backup provider meets WSG compliance and other obligations along with having a sustainability statement with required content.</p>
