		<section> <!-- What is web sustainability? -->
			<h2>What is web sustainability?</h2>
			<p>The goal of Web Sustainability is to design, develop, and operate digital products and services such that they meet the needs of the present while ensuring future generations can meet their own needs.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>At the time of publication, we have crossed <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html">seven of nine planetary boundaries</a>. The impact of this is seen in communities and ecosystems around the world.</li>
					<li>Technology hastens these overshoots, contributing to a trajectory that is not in line with any sustainable development targets. This is especially true of artificial intelligence and other emerging, resource-intensive technologies.</li>
					<li>Sustainable development supports strong social foundations within planetary limits. It acknowledges interdependence and helps us rethink how we create value. In other words, instead of merely 'doing less harm', we strive to restore ecosystems and support communities to help them thrive.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Web sustainability aims to apply sustainable development principles to the creation and management of digital products, services, and content delivered via the web. It represents the ambition to design, develop, and maintain digital products and services. Web sustainability acknowledges that the web is both part of the problem and part of the solution</p>
			<p>Web sustainability envisions an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/">ethical</a> and more <a href="https://humanewebmanifesto.com/">humane web</a> that provides <a href="https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/">environmental, social, and economic benefits</a> to everyone who uses it. The Web Sustainability Guidelines offer a roadmap to achieve this</p>
		</section>
		<section> <!-- The importance of web sustainability -->
			<h2>The importance of web sustainability</h2>
			<p>Most people are aware of "green" issues. However, fewer understand that digital products and services directly contribute to the climate crisis. With the Internet producing more emissions than the entire aviation industry, anyone with an online presence can get involved and make a difference.</p>
			<p>It's also worth remembering that good sustainability is about improving things for both people and the planet; therefore, while the environmental impact is important, reducing the harms that can occur from unsustainable work is also beneficial.</p>
			<p>Collectively, by focusing on web sustainability, we have a real chance to make a global impact on the climate crisis going forward. Digital impacts are often proportional, with the biggest websites requiring the most change. However, larger organizations also have more resources to make that change. Plus, the web often beats the physical world to solutions due to a focus on agility and continuous improvement.</p>
		</section>
		<section> <!-- Emissions vs. PPP -->
			<h2>Emissions vs. PPP</h2>
			<p>Many sustainability guidelines follow what are often referred to as <abbr title="Planet, People, and Prosperity">PPP</abbr> principles.</p>
			<p>Sustainability's three pillars include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Planet</strong>: Protecting environmental ecosystems.</li>
				<li><strong>People</strong>: Protecting individuals, communities, and society as a whole.</li>
				<li><strong>Prosperity</strong>: Practices grounded in good governance and shared equity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>While environmental factors cover planetary issues like emissions and waste, it is also critical to consider other intersectional issues related to people and society, such as accessibility, privacy, security, and prosperity factors such as good (and ethical) governance, reducing issues such as neocolonialism. In other words, investing in people correlates to positive effects on sustainability:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For example, good web performance can improve user experience while also reducing the physical impact of a site in terms of size, loading, rendering times, etc.</li>
				<li>Similarly, good governance and ethical economic practices improve organizations. In turn, these organizations can also outperform their more traditional counterparts on a variety of indicators, including sustainability and long-term financial performance.</li>
				<li>Also, ensuring your product or service is compatible on older devices and slower or unstable connections not only forces the regulation of avoiding overly burdensome experiences that could prevent access, especially those in developing nations or at-risk groups, but it also will help reduce the need for device upgrades if the user is dependent on such tooling, leading to less e-waste.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Web sustainability also encompasses more than just carbon/energy emissions [[VARIABLES]]. Material waste, chemical pollution, water waste, electronic waste, and other impacts need to be measured, accounted for, and reduced where possible from digital products and services.</p>
		</section>
		<section> <!-- Accounting and measurement -->
			<h2>Accounting and measurement</h2>
			<p>Sustainability measurement is challenging in any industry. This is exacerbated by the fact that sustainability is still a rapidly evolving and emerging field. With the Internet, this becomes especially difficult.</p>
			<p>Many data gaps exist when measuring emissions across the Internet stack. While we do have some information on electrical usage for servers, device usage, and, to an extent, rendering, we don't have a complete picture of the entire web ecosystem. In addition to emissions, we also come up short on data related to other important impacts like mineral waste, water waste, e-waste, material waste, and so on.</p>
			<p>The Internet is anything but simplistic in how its infrastructure works. Because of this, we must take a holistic approach to sustainability, including web sustainability. In other words, restricting our focus to the obvious causes of electrical waste—otherwise referred to as "carbon tunnel vision"—sabotages our ability to consider the impact of the entire system.</p>
			<p>Notably, as one issue can impact another, a "butterfly effect" of unintended consequences or tradeoffs that undermine long-term sustainability efforts or beneficial side effects that enrich people and the planet can result from the choices we make. This is why it pays to consider all forces that might be affected by our work and decisions. For example, actions you take may have a low impact on preserving water but a high impact on preserving electricity.</p>
			<p>It should also be noted that a drawback of the sustainability sector is that unlike other forms of measurement in other fields (such as web performance and accessibility) where binary conversations can occur (something either "is" or "is not" happening), there is unlikely to be a situation where a product or service is never emitting or causing some sort of impact upon the environment by nature of it existing. As such, implementors need to firstly reduce what you can, then for what you cannot (as emissions will likely always occur to some extent) compensate for these continuous emissions to ensure as minimal a footprint as possible.</p>
			<p>More research is needed to help us collectively understand how best to achieve web sustainability goals. Creating consensus on terms and the language we use to describe these goals is a step in the right direction.</p>
		</section>
		<section> <!-- The current landscape -->
			<h2>The current landscape</h2>
			<p>Every part of the Internet has some sort of environmental impact from the developer's machine, to web service providers, to the physical infrastructure that carries data, right through to hosting and consumer devices. Aiming to reduce the impact of these different mechanisms, where possible, is as much a part of an individual or organization's responsibility as driving sales or improving customer service.</p>
			<p>Increasingly, through awareness of such issues, the public and press have placed pressure upon industries to become more ethically aware and push for sustainable change. With several governments seeking regulatory enforcement in this area, the need to make our products and services become more sustainable and reduce their impact will increase.</p>
			<p>Whether you work in hosting, back-end development, front-end development, user experience design, information architecture, content authoring, user-interface design, run a business, manage a product or service, or have another role, there are many opportunities to create meaningful change: performance optimizations, waste reduction techniques, emissions measurement, impact reporting practices, or other as yet unknown tactics, to name just a few.</p>
			<p>We need champions within industries and organizations to spearhead web sustainability practices and meet these challenges head-on.</p>
		</section>
		<section> <!-- The Web Sustainability Guidelines -->
			<h2>The Web Sustainability Guidelines</h2>
			<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/">Web Sustainability Guidelines</a> (WSG) were created to help individuals and businesses more easily obtain implementable advice that would have a sustainable benefit on their digital products and services. Previously, best practices were scattered and not easy to find with new resources appearing regularly. In this environment, keeping tabs on the latest information is challenging.</p>
			<p>Plus, many of these resources do not weigh cited evidence with regulatory references that are aligned with common sustainability reporting standards. This makes it difficult for organizations to include the impact of digital products and services in reports they're already working on.</p>
			<p>If you are aware of the World Wide Web Consortium's (<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[WCAG22]], it may not surprise you to know that the WSG were inspired by them. As such, these guidelines can be considered very similar, except that our goal is to make the web more sustainable. Equally, if you've read a W3C specification, the WSG will look familiar.</p>
			<p>The WSG are not only based on measurable, evidence-based research wherever possible but the work is also aligned with open standards from the Global Reporting Initiative (<abbr title="Global Reporting Initiative">[[GRI]]</abbr>), in readiness for helping organizations meet compliance targets. This is especially relevant for upcoming legislation in the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (<abbr title="Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive">[[CSRD]]</abbr>), alongside additional standards and laws we aligned our work with. Hopefully, this will prove useful to drive change as part of a wider portfolio of evidence to reduce emissions and improve sustainability.</p>
		</section>
		<section> <!-- Incorporating the guidelines into your work -->
			<h2>Incorporating the guidelines into your work</h2>
			<p>When utilizing the Web Sustainability Guidelines, a progress-over-perfection approach is advised. The specification is very long and may appear quite intimidating. However, if you examine the accompanying quick reference, the guidelines are a lot less dense than they might initially appear. The best way to get started is to scroll through the categories (picking which suits your skillset) and choose items that you feel you can make a mark on easily.</p>
			<p>Also, the guidelines are written from the perspective of those who work on the web. For example, advisory guidelines in the web development section use technical terms common to that industry. User experience design guidelines adopt the terminology of this discipline. And so on.</p>
			<p>If the description, success criteria, or examples are confusing, expandable resources can help you delve into each topic with third parties providing explanatory details of how to implement and accomplish such tasks.</p>
			<p>Finally, these guidelines are meant to help you get started quickly on a journey of continuous learning and improvement. You do not need to read or adopt them in a specific order or all at once.</p>
			<p>Do not worry about getting things wrong or even if you can only do a couple of things—if we all made a few small changes to our own little corner of the web, this would make a huge difference! If you can scope out the time to drop in some more sustainability improvements later, great. If you can design sustainability into your process from the start, even better. However, it is something that will constantly evolve and need work.</p>
			<p>Here are answers to some common questions about the guidelines.</p>
			<section class="notoc">
				<h3>What can people do?</h3>
				<p>Speak out on and learn about sustainability issues! If your organization is not yet doing anything, propose an initiative and offer to train coworkers. If you work with partner organizations that could use help, offer to be that resource. Just be sure to meet them where they are. Web sustainability can be intimidating to newcomers. Offer to help get them started on their learning path.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="notoc">
				<h3>What can designers of new web platform features do?</h3>
				<p>Make sure that tooling is accessible, performant, private by design, secure, non-exploitative, and powered by low-carbon energy. If your product or service is for the public good, ensure its infrastructure is tightly optimized and meets the WSG. In turn, this will help you get a leg up on potential regulatory requirements down the line.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="notoc">
				<h3>What can browsers do?</h3>
				<p>Browser makers have a few key opportunities: optimize their rendering processes as much as possible, reduce resource utilization, do not do anything unethical within a product, and keep improving developer tooling!</p>
			</section>
			<section class="notoc">
				<h3>What can hardware vendors do?</h3>
				<p>Hardware vendors can improve software efficiency with their products, reduce production waste through circular economy practices, and increase product life cycles with a greater focus on maintenance.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="notoc">
				<h3>What can regulators do?</h3>
				<p>Regulators can ensure that digital sustainability has a prominent role to play in both climate change modeling (due to its impact) and climate reduction targets (due to the significant economic and cultural force it has on the world's current and future population).</p>
